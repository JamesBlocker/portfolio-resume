                                    <p>Etch is a web app that utilizes the IBM’s Watson, the super computer, API to accurately analyze language in context and reveal underlying emotions. The idea was originally to provide a service for those with social disabilities such Asperger Syndrome where sometimes what is communicated does not line up with the intent due to overlooked social cues and norms. By contextually analyzing text we can identify primary emotions being broadcast such as fear, joy, and anger.</p>

                                    <p>We quickly learned that the app was fun to use analyzing all manner of text. Soon users were checking out their favorite song lyrics, poems, and passages from books. The results were generally very surprising and fun. The app was built as a 4 person team at General Assembly, Team Sherlock, and I was lead app designer and in charge of the API design and visual design. The app was featured in our schools “Best Of” newsletter to alumni and prospective students.</p>
